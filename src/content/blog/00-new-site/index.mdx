## A simple, minimalist portfolio!

Decided to explore using a Markdown-oriented Astro template for setting up this new blog & portfolio.

- Template:
  - Description: https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-micro/
  - Github page: https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro

It's simple to setup and add new content categories. For example, I added "Old Projects" to showcase past career projects.

It uses TailwindCSS-- Which, I'm not a huge fan of because I think it clutters html with css, which I prefer to be decoupled into CSS Stylesheets. But that's ok! I like exploring new frameworks.

I deploy it with Vercel, which makes Deployment a breeze. I only use Vercel for simple, small projects because it's free and easy. For more complex projects, I prefer rolling my own Github Actions CICD and deploying to a DigitalOcean server (Which I boot up with Terraform.)
