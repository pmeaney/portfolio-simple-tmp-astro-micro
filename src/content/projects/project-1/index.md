## Exploring using Vendure for consulting projects & side hustles

In the Summer of 2025, I began exploring Content Management Systems and really liked PayloadCMS, a Typescript-based framework. However, PayloadCMS's ecommerce plugin is still in beta mode as of early 2026.

So, after learning about [Vendure](https://vendure.io/) I began exploring its "my-shop" template. It looked well built, easy to figure out, and easy to get up and running.

However, its template wasn't Containerized. I decided to take it upon myself to create a containerized template and set it up for production-ready CICD Deployment, a project I call [vendure-juniper010726](https://github.com/pmeaney/vendure-juniper010726/). (As a nature-lover decided to give my projects tree-species code names, for eventual blue-green deployment, using tree names instead of colors)

On January 30, 2026 I released v2.0-- the Prototype Production version. Next up, I'll add:

- Additional security features to the Debian server
- Placeholder products
- Initial point-of-sale software accounts (Stripe, Paypal) for initial payment testing

Once those items are working, I'll release v3.0 -- the Production Ready version. And if all goes according to plan, I'll have a simple dropshipping store side-hustle.
